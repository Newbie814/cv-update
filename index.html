            I have sifted through massive amounts of fitness, health, and
            nutrition data and distilled it down to what actually matters and
            what we actually have some control over. That saves you time and
            effort, while keeping you efficiently working
            towards your goals.

          <h3>What does matter?</h3>
          <p>
            On the food side, it's easy. It's a plant. It's an animal. Or, it's
            crap. Eat a variety of plants. Eat a variety of animals, unless you
            object. Every now and then enjoy some crap.

        <h3>What about excercise?</h3>
        <p>
          Easy. Don't chase calorie burn. It don't work that way. Exercise is integral for weight management, health, and quality of life. It just doesn't do what you think it does. You've got 2 buckets you need to fill. 1. Your overall activity level. And you need a lot more than you think. You ain't filling it in the gym. Luckily, it all counts. Dancing. Playing with your kids. Gardening. Yoga. Group classes. You do you. It counts. As long as you're moving. 2. Is activity that stresses your bones and muscles enough to give your body a reason to hang on to it or grow it. That means your muscles need to be the limiting factor, not your lungs. Luckily, you don't really need a whole lot of it. You <strong class="can">can</strong> get enough of this in the gym. Sadly, 95%+ of regular gym-goers never fill either bucket. They go do their 30 minute interval class and think they're good. Meanwile they haven't done nearly enough time to fill up their activity bucket, nor have they stressed their bones or muscles nearly enough to cause adaptations. They end up with some base level endurance adaptations. Which, is good in itself. It's just not the main or only thing most people are looking for.
